# WP Image Optimizer Security Guidelines

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the WP Image Optimizer plugin and provides guidelines for secure usage.

## Security Features

### Input Validation and Sanitization

- All user inputs are validated and sanitized using WordPress functions
- File uploads are validated for MIME type and file extension
- Path traversal attacks are prevented through path sanitization
- Form submissions are protected with nonce verification

### File System Security

- File operations are restricted to WordPress upload directories
- Temporary directories are protected with .htaccess rules
- File permissions are checked before operations
- Sanitized file paths are used throughout the plugin

### Authentication and Authorization

- WordPress capability checks are used for all admin operations
- WP-CLI commands require appropriate permissions
- Admin pages require 'manage_options' capability
- AJAX endpoints are protected with nonce verification

### Error Handling and Logging

- Sensitive information is never exposed in error messages
- Detailed error logs are only accessible to administrators
- Critical errors trigger admin notifications
- Error recovery mechanisms prevent cascading failures

## Security Best Practices for Users

### Server Configuration

1. **Web Server Rules**: Use the provided Nginx or Apache configurations to serve converted images directly
2. **File Permissions**: Ensure WordPress upload directories have appropriate permissions (755 for directories, 644 for files)
3. **PHP Settings**: Set appropriate memory limits and execution times for image processing

### Plugin Configuration

1. **Access Control**: Restrict plugin access to trusted administrators only
2. **File Size Limits**: Set reasonable maximum file size limits to prevent resource exhaustion
3. **Allowed MIME Types**: Restrict conversion to known safe image formats
4. **Error Logging**: Review error logs periodically for suspicious activity

### Secure Deployment

1. **Regular Updates**: Keep the plugin updated to the latest version
2. **Testing**: Test plugin updates in a staging environment before deploying to production
3. **Backups**: Maintain regular backups of your images and database
4. **Monitoring**: Monitor server resources during batch operations
