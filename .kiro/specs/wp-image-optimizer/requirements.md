# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a WordPress plugin that provides automatic image optimization and conversion capabilities. The plugin will convert images (JPG, PNG, etc.) to modern formats (WebP, AVIF) using server-side ImageMagick or GD libraries, with both UI and CLI interfaces for management and configuration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a WordPress site administrator, I want to automatically convert uploaded images to modern formats (WebP, AVIF), so that my website loads faster and provides better user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads an image (JPG, PNG, GIF) THEN the system SHALL automatically generate WebP and AVIF versions
2. WHEN ImageMagick is available on the server THEN the system SHALL use ImageMagick for image conversion
3. WHEN ImageMagick is not available but GD is available THEN the system SHALL use GD library for image conversion
4. WHEN neither ImageMagick nor GD is available THEN the system SHALL display an error message and disable conversion features
5. IF the original image is already in WebP or AVIF format THEN the system SHALL skip conversion for that format

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to receive the most optimized image format my browser supports, so that pages load quickly without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a browser requests an image AND supports AVIF THEN the system SHALL serve the AVIF version if available
2. WHEN a browser requests an image AND supports WebP but not AVIF THEN the system SHALL serve the WebP version if available
3. WHEN a browser requests an image AND doesn't support modern formats THEN the system SHALL serve the original image
4. IF a converted image doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL create it on-demand and serve it
5. WHEN serving images THEN the system SHALL set appropriate cache headers for optimal performance

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a WordPress administrator, I want to configure image optimization settings through the WordPress admin interface, so that I can customize the plugin behavior without technical knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the plugin settings page THEN the system SHALL display options for quality settings for WebP and AVIF
2. WHEN accessing the plugin settings page THEN the system SHALL display options to enable/disable specific formats
3. WHEN accessing the plugin settings page THEN the system SHALL display current server capabilities (ImageMagick/GD status)
4. WHEN saving settings THEN the system SHALL validate all input values and display appropriate error messages
5. WHEN settings are changed THEN the system SHALL provide option to regenerate existing images with new settings

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer or system administrator, I want to manage image optimization via WP-CLI commands, so that I can automate and script image processing tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running wp-cli command THEN the system SHALL provide commands to convert all existing images
2. WHEN running wp-cli command THEN the system SHALL provide commands to convert specific images by ID or path
3. WHEN running wp-cli command THEN the system SHALL provide commands to configure plugin settings
4. WHEN running wp-cli command THEN the system SHALL display progress information for batch operations
5. WHEN running wp-cli command with invalid parameters THEN the system SHALL display helpful error messages and usage instructions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a server administrator, I want to configure my web server to serve optimized images automatically, so that the image optimization works seamlessly without PHP overhead for each request.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing plugin settings THEN the system SHALL generate Nginx configuration snippets for automatic image serving
2. WHEN accessing plugin settings THEN the system SHALL generate Apache .htaccess rules for automatic image serving
3. WHEN web server rules are active THEN the system SHALL serve converted images directly without PHP processing
4. WHEN web server rules are active AND converted image doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL fall back to PHP processing to create and serve the image
5. WHEN configuration is generated THEN the system SHALL include comments explaining each rule and its purpose

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a WordPress site owner, I want the plugin to follow WordPress coding standards and security best practices, so that my site remains secure and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN plugin code is executed THEN the system SHALL follow WordPress Coding Standards (WPCS)
2. WHEN handling file uploads THEN the system SHALL validate file types and sanitize file names
3. WHEN processing user input THEN the system SHALL sanitize and validate all data
4. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL use WordPress nonces for form security
5. WHEN accessing files THEN the system SHALL check user permissions and capabilities
6. WHEN plugin is activated THEN the system SHALL check for required PHP extensions and WordPress version

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a WordPress administrator, I want flexible configuration options that can be set via UI, CLI, or wp-config.php, so that I can manage settings in the most appropriate way for my setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration is set in wp-config.php THEN the system SHALL use those values as defaults
2. WHEN configuration is set via CLI THEN the system SHALL update the database settings
3. WHEN configuration is set via UI THEN the system SHALL override CLI and wp-config settings
4. WHEN multiple configuration sources exist THEN the system SHALL follow precedence: UI > CLI > wp-config > defaults
5. WHEN displaying settings in UI THEN the system SHALL indicate which settings are overridden by wp-config

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a WordPress site owner, I want minimal database usage for the plugin, so that my database remains fast and doesn't get bloated with unnecessary data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing plugin settings THEN the system SHALL use a single options entry in wp_options table
2. WHEN tracking converted images THEN the system SHALL use file system checks rather than database storage
3. WHEN plugin needs to store temporary data THEN the system SHALL use WordPress transients with appropriate expiration
4. WHEN plugin is uninstalled THEN the system SHALL provide option to clean up all database entries
5. IF database queries are necessary THEN the system SHALL use WordPress caching mechanisms to minimize database hits

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a WordPress administrator, I want to monitor and manage the image optimization process, so that I can ensure it's working correctly and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing plugin dashboard THEN the system SHALL display statistics on converted images and space savings
2. WHEN conversion fails THEN the system SHALL log errors with detailed information for troubleshooting
3. WHEN accessing plugin settings THEN the system SHALL provide tools to test image conversion capabilities
4. WHEN bulk operations are running THEN the system SHALL display progress and allow cancellation
5. WHEN plugin encounters errors THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and suggested solutions
